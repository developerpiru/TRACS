A set of demo files to try out TRACS are available on Google Drive here:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FhI5w7vMiEOKwbkBmDDFbpabxZVVrKuz

File size: 2GB


If using a cloud server, you should download it directly to your server using a browser.


Unzip the archive and make sure it is available in a shared folder if using Docker:
- For TRACS Docker on Windows, this is your `C:\` drive.
- For TRACS Docker on Linux, this is whatever path you launched TRACS Docker with using `/path/to/folder`, ie `$HOME/`
- For TRACS Docker On Mac OS, this is your `/Volumes` path so you can place it in any drive.



This zip archive contains:
- the initial library CSV file (a table of all sgRNAs)
- one initial library read
- two replicates of Cas9-positive Control reads (A and B)
- two replicates of Cas9-negative Control reads (A and B)
- two replicates of Cas9-positive Mutant reads (A and B)
- two replicates of Cas9-negative Mutant reads (A and B)
 
 
The Control group is the **Initial** condition.

The Mutant group is the **Final** condition.
